# More Tab / Saved Recordings

Use the Saved Recordings section in the More tab to review, share, or remove the local MP4 archives created when you enable **Save Recording** on the Go Live confirmation screen.

## Locate Recordings
- Each entry shows `HOME @ AWAY` with the recording date/time and an optional part number (if you stopped and restarted the livesteam multiple times).

## Share a Recording
1. Tap the share icon on the right edge of the row.
2. Pick AirDrop, Messages, Mail, or another destination to send the MP4.

## Save to Photos
1. Swipe left on a recording and tap **Save**.
2. Grant Photos access the first time so the video can be copied into your library.

## Delete a Recording
1. Swipe left on a recording and tap **Delete**.
2. Confirm to remove the MP4 from the device. This cannot be undone.

## Tips
- Keep **Save Recording** enabled when you want a local archive; disable it to conserve storage.

# Messages Panel

During a broadcast, use the Messages panel to trigger saved overlays and Celly Stickers.

## Basics
1. Pick Home or Away for team-based overlays.
2. Override the on-screen duration if needed.
3. Tap a saved message or sticker to display it immediately.

## Managing Messages
- Create and edit overlays in the [Messages Tab](messages-tab).
- The panel lists only the messages for the current sport and sorts them by name.

## FAQ
- Use descriptive names so you can find messages quickly while live.
- Keep durations short for quick announcements.
- Celly Stickers add personality; use them sparingly so they do not cover live action.

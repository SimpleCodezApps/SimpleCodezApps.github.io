# Messages Panel

During a broadcast, use the Messages panel to trigger saved overlays, Celly Stickers, and watermarks.

## Basics
1. Pick Home or Away for team-based overlays.
2. Override the on-screen duration if needed.
3. Tap a saved message or sticker to display it immediately.

## Using Watermarks
Watermarks are persistent overlays that stay visible in the bottom-right corner until you remove them.

1. Tap a watermark in the Messages panel to display it on your stream.
2. The watermark remains on screen until you tap it again to dismiss it.
3. Only one watermark can be active at a time—tapping a new watermark replaces the current one.

## Managing Messages
- Create and edit overlays in the [Messages Tab](messages-tab).
- The panel lists only the messages for the current sport and sorts them by name.

## FAQ
- Use descriptive names so you can find messages quickly while live.
- Keep durations short for quick announcements.
- Celly Stickers add personality; use them sparingly so they do not cover live action.
- Watermarks work well for sponsor logos or team branding that should stay visible throughout the broadcast.

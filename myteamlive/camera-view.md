The Camera View combines the preview, control bar, zoom tools, and control panels while you are on air.

## Preview
The live preview shows exactly what the audience sees.

## Control Bar
Use the top control bar to start or pause publishing, mute audio, stop, and monitor stream state. Learn more in the [Control Bar guide](control-bar).

## Zoom Tools
Open the [Zoom](zoom) slider on the right edge to adjust magnification. Preset buttons let you jump between near, medium, and far framing.

## Control Panels
Open panels along the bottom edge to manage:
- Scoreboard, including sport-specific states ([Scoreboard Panel](scoreboard-panel))
- Custom messages and Celly Stickers ([Messages Panel](messages-panel))
- Sport-specific event prompts ([Events Panel](events-panel))
- Stream telemetry ([Stream Info Panel](stream-info-panel))

When [Remote Control](remote-control) is connected, toggle the Remote Control switch if you need to reclaim the panels on the camera device.

All on-screen controls stay on the device; only your overlays and video reach the stream.

# Live Streams Tab
[Back to Help Index](index)

Use the Live Streams tab to connect MyTeamLive with YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, or any RTMP/RTMPS service.

## Choosing a Service
- **YouTube** supports on-demand and scheduled broadcasts. Stream directly with your account or configure a shared stream key.
- **Shared YouTube channels** usually require scheduling on the web and using a dedicated endpoint.
- **Twitch** is on-demand; account streaming and endpoint streaming work similarly. Configure VOD settings on the web if you need replays.
- **Facebook** events must be scheduled on the web, then paired with an endpoint in the app.
- **Other services** work as long as you have an ingest URL and stream key.

## Accounts
1. Open Live Streams and tap **Add Account**.
2. Choose YouTube or Twitch and complete sign-in and permissions.
3. Use the list to refresh tokens or swipe to remove an account.
4. Return to [Go Live](go-live) to select an account, set broadcast details, and confirm privacy/audience settings.

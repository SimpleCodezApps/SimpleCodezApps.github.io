MyTeamLive lets you live stream your games with a built-in scoreboard, overlays, and easy-to-use controls:

  - Live stream with a full scoreboard: period clock, shots on goal, and penalties
  - Custom overlays for goals, penalties, player shoutouts, and team messages
  - Celly Stickers to celebrate big plays
  - Standby mode with intermission screen between periods
  - Local recording option to upload or share later
  - Multi-platform support: YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and others
  - Remote control from a second device to run the scoreboard and events

If you’re new to streaming, start with YouTube—it’s the fastest path to get your team’s games online and shareable. Watch our short [YouTube setup walkthrough](https://youtu.be/GPWg77zxQ6s).

MyTeamLive for Apple iOS is currently in beta and is free to use during the beta-test. To join, complete this [short form](https://forms.gle/wdPUWXzVGfPxoLwC8).

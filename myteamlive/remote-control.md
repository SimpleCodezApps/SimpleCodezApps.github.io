# More Tab / Remote Control

Remote Control lets a second phone manage the scoreboard, events, and messages
while the camera phone streams the broadcast.

## Prepare the Camera

1. In Go Live, advance to the confirmation step (step 4 of 4).
2. Give the camera a recognizable name (for example, "Jane's Phone").
3. Toggle **Remote Control** on.
4. Share the four-digit PIN with the remote control.
5. The camera will now accept any valid remote control connection, and you can
   start the broadcast by tapping **Continue**.

## Connect the Remote Control

1. Open the More tab and choose Remote Control.
2. Give the remote control a recognizable name.
3. Tap **Browse**, wait for the camera name to appear, then select it.
4. Enter the PIN for the camera and tap **Connect**.
5. The status changes to "Waiting for camera to start" once paired.
6. Once the camera operator presses continue and starts the Camera View, the
   Remote Control UI will appear.
7. If the camera is already in the Camera View, the Remote Control UI will
   appear after the two phones synchronize their data.

## Using Remote Control

- Use the Remote Control toggle to bring control back to the Camera View without disconnecting the Remote Control.
- The PIN for the camera is shown on the remote control toggle.
- The Remote Control UI replaces the Scoreboard, Events, and Messages panels on
  the camera but does not control any of the camera or zoom controls.
- The Remote Control UI shows a question mark for Celly Stickers instead of an icon of the graphic.

## Disconnecting and Reconnecting

- Tap **Disconnect** on the remote control to end the session.
- The camera automatically disconnects the remote control when the broadcast
  finishes.
- If the link drops, the Camera View shows "Disconnected" next to the Remote
  Control toggle and the remote control returns to the connection screen.
  Re-enter the displayed PIN and tap **Connect**.

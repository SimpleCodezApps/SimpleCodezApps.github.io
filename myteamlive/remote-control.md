# More Tab / Remote Control

Remote Control lets a second device manage the scoreboard, events, and messages while the camera device streams.

## Prepare the Camera Device
1. In Go Live, advance to the confirmation step (step 4 of 4).
2. Give the device a useful name (for example, "Jane's Phone").
3. Toggle **Remote Control** on.
4. Share the four-digit PIN with the helper device.

## Connect the Remote Device
1. On the helper device, open the More tab and choose Remote Control.
2. Set a recognizable device name.
3. Tap **Browse**, wait for the camera device to appear, then select it.
4. Enter the PIN shown on the camera device and tap **Connect**.
5. The status changes to "Waiting for camera to start" once paired.

## Start the Broadcast
1. On the camera device, tap Continue.
2. When ready, tap **Go Live** to open the Camera View and Remote Controller view simultaneously.

## Using Remote Control
- The Remote Control UI replaces the Scoreboard, Events, and Messages panels on the camera device.
- Use the toggle on the camera device to enable or disable Remote Control if you need local access to the panels.

## Disconnecting and Reconnecting
- Tap **Disconnect** on the remote device to end the session.
- The camera automatically disconnects the remote when the broadcast finishes.
- If the link drops, the Camera View shows "Disconnected" next to the Remote Control switch and the remote returns to the connection screen. Re-enter the remembered PIN and tap **Connect** while the Camera View remains open.

# More Tab / Remote Control
Remote Control lets a second phone manage the scoreboard, events, and messages while the Camera phone streams the broadcast.

## Prepare the Camera
1. In Go Live, advance to the confirmation step (step 4 of 4).
2. Optionally, give the Camera a recognizable device name (for example, "Jane's Phone").
3. Toggle **Remote Control** on.
4. Share the four-digit PIN with the Remote Control.
5. You do not need to wait for the Remote Control to connect, the Camera will accept connections even while open.

## Connect the Remote Control
1. Open the More tab and choose Remote Control.
2. Optionally, edit the Remote Control device name.
3. Tap **Browse**, wait for the Camera device name to appear, then select it.
4. Enter the PIN for the Camera and tap **Connect**.
5. The status changes to "Waiting for Camera to start" once paired.
6. Once the Camera starts, the Remote Control UI will appear.

## Using the Remote Control
The Remote Control UI replaces the Clock, Scoreboard, Events, and Messages panels on the Camera but does not control any of the LiveStream or zoom controls.

## Taking Control Back for the Camera
- Use the Remote Control toggle to bring control back to the Camera View without disconnecting the Remote Control.
- The PIN for the Camera is shown next to the Remote Control toggle.

## Disconnecting and Reconnecting
- Tap **Disconnect** on the Remote Control to disconnect from the Camera.
- The Camera automatically disconnects the Remote Control when the Camera is closed.
- If the link drops, the Camera View shows "Disconnected" next to the Remote Control toggle.
- If the link drops, the Remote Control returns to the connection screen.  Re-enter the PIN and tap **Connect**.

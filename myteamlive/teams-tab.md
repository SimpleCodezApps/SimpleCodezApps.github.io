Add teams so scoreboards and team-based messages know which colors and logos to use.

## Add a Team
1. Open the Teams tab and tap **Add Team**.
2. Enter the team name.
3. Choose the sport.
4. Pick a team logo from your photo library (add it to Photos first).
5. Set text and background colors for overlays.
6. Use the color picker to sample directly from the logo: drag the loupe over the color you want, release to capture it, then close the picker.

   <p style="text-align:center;">
     <img src="/images/ColorPicker.png" alt="Color picker sampling from logo" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:12px;">
   </p>
7. Confirm the live preview at the top of the color section matches your design.
8. Tap **Save**.

## Tips
- Team colors populate scoreboards and team-format messages automatically.
- You can edit any team later by selecting it from the list.
- Teams are sport specific.

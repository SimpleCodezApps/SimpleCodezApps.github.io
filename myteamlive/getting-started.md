# Getting Started

MyTeamLive works with YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and any RTMP/RTMPS service to let you stream games with overlays for scores, events, custom messages, and Celly Stickers.

1. Set up team details in the [Teams Tab](teams-tab).
2. Sign into YouTube or Twitch, or configure another service in the [Live Streams Tab](live-streams).
3. For advanced control, pre-create the stream on the platform and copy its stream key into a Live Stream endpoint.
4. Start your broadcast from the [Go Live Tab](go-live).
5. Use the [Scoreboard Panel](scoreboard-panel) and [Messages Panel](messages-panel) to show overlays.
6. Pair a second device with [Remote Control](remote-control) to manage the scoreboard, events, and Celly Stickers.
7. A subscription is required to stream. Begin a 7-day free trial from the Go Live tab.

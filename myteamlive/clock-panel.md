# Clock Panel

Only available when using the Ribbon scorebug with Hockey.

Manage the game clock, player advantage, and penalties on the scorebug.


## Basics
- **Start** start the game clock.
- **Stop** stop the game clock.
- **Reset** reset the game clock (defaults to 00:00).

The Game Clock runs down to 0. If you reset the Game Clock and there are active penalties, use *Save & Adjust Penalties* to keep the penalties in sync with the Game Clock.

## Penalties
List of active penalties, penalties can be expired or edited.
- **Add Penalty** add a new penalty

Penalty clocks run with the game clock. A penalty clock that goes to 0 expires and is removed. If a side has multiple penalties, a **+** will indicate that there are other penalties counting down.

Because of the basic controls, if a player gets consecutive penalties, i.e. two minors for head contact, enter one penalty, and then enter the second penalty once the first expires.

# Clock Panel

Only available when using the Ribbon scorebug with Hockey.

Manage the game clock, player advantage, and penalties on the scorebug.


## Basics
- **Start** start the game clock.
- **Stop** stop the game clock.
- **Edit** edit the game clock (defaults to 00:00).
- **Player Advantage** shows which team has the advantage.
- **Empty Net** toggle the empty net message.


The Game Clock runs down to 0. If you reset the Game Clock and there are active penalties, use the Update penalties toggle to keep the penalties in sync with the Game Clock.

## Penalties
List of active penalties; each can be edited or cleared.
- **Add Penalty** add a new penalty

Penalty clocks run with the game clock. A penalty clock that goes to 0 expires and is removed. If a side has multiple penalties, a **+** will indicate that there are other penalties counting down.

Use the double minor toggle to indicate a double minor. When the double minor expires or is cleared, it starts a second time to cover both minors.

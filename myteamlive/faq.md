## Should I film in portrait orientation?

Streams are designed for landscape orientation; portrait will be letterboxed on most platforms.

## Do I need a microphone for audio?

The built-in microphone is used by default. Wired or Bluetooth headsets with a mic improve the quality of the audio and reduce the ambient noise.

## I cannot connect to the server, what should I check first?

Connections fail if the stream key is wrong. Double-check it in Live Streams.

Also, some firewalls will block outbound RTMP/RTMPS and prevent connections.

## What is the network indicator telling me about the stream?

The network indicator should generally be green and occasionally yellow. If it is consistently yellow you may want to restart with a lower FPS or quality or both.

YouTube recommends that your connection should be streaming at least 2000-3000 KBps for 720p, and double that for 1080p.

Experience has shown that 720p @ 30 FPS has good quality even at lower speeds (i.e. 500KBps), which is usually possible via 5G cell service.

If you cannot get a steady connection, you can record the game locally and then upload the video.

## Can I reconnect to an existing live stream?

Many services let you stop and restart a stream at the same quality and FPS without creating a new event.

## The Remote Control disconnected mid stream?

You can reconnect the Remote Control any time while the Camera View is open. Additionally, the Remote Control will try to connect via Bluetooth if both devices are within close proximity and have Bluetooth on.

## How do I get team logos?

An easy way to get them is to go to the team website on your phone, select the logo, and save to your photos.

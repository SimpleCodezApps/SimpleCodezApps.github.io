# FAQ

- Streams are designed for landscape orientation; portrait will be letterboxed on most platforms.
- The built-in microphone is used by default. Wired or Bluetooth headsets with a mic improve commentary audio.
- Add team logos to your photo library before creating teams.
- Many services let you stop and restart a stream without creating a new event.
- Connections fail if the stream key is wrong. Double-check it in Live Streams.
- Firewalls that block outbound RTMP/RTMPS will prevent connections.
- The network indicator should generally be green and occasionally yellow. Ideally your connection should be streaming at 2000-3000 KBps for 720p, and double that for 1080p.
- You can reconnect the Remote Control any time while the Camera View is open.

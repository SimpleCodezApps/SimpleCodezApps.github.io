[Back to Help Index](index)

- Streams are designed for landscape orientation; portrait will be letterboxed on most platforms.
- The built-in microphone is used by default. Wired or Bluetooth headsets with a mic improve commentary audio.
- Add team logos to your photo library before creating teams.
- Many services let you stop and restart a stream shortly after ending without creating a new event.
- Connections fail if the stream key is wrong. Double-check it in Live Streams.
- Firewalls that block outbound RTMP/RTMPS will prevent connections.
- FPS and Quality cannot change while live.
- If the network indicator turns yellow (unstable), stop and restart at 720p or 30 FPS; the app picks an appropriate bitrate automatically.
- You can reconnect the Remote Control any time while the Camera View is open.

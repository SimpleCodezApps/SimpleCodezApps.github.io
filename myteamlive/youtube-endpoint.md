# YouTube Endpoint Guide

Schedule a YouTube broadcast and then go live on your device. Watch the tutorial video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GPWg77zxQ6s).

## Schedule a Broadcast on the Web

1. Open a browser on your laptop and go to [https://studio.youtube.com](https://studio.youtube.com).
2. Click **Create** and select **Go live**.
3. If you do not already have a channel, YouTube will prompt you to create your default channel.
4. If this is your first time going live, YouTube will prompt you to verify your account. This will take about 24 hours to complete.
5. Click **Manage**, then **Schedule Stream**.
6. Enter title, description, category, audience, and other options.
7. Click **Next** to configure chat and visibility.
8. Set the date and time, then click **Done**.
9. Copy the stream key.
10. Toggle **Enable Auto-start**.
11. Toggle **Enable Auto-stop**.
12. Toggle **Enable DVR** to allow replays.
13. After scheduling your first broadcast you can reuse prior settings.

## Configure the Endpoint in MyTeamLive

1. In the [Live Streams Tab](live-streams), tap **Add Live Stream**.
2. Choose YouTube as the service to auto-fill the ingest URL.
3. Paste the stream key you copied.
4. Name the destination so you recognize it later.
5. Tap **Save**. The key can be reused for future broadcasts.

_Do this once, update if the stream key is changed._

## Go Live

1. Open the [Go Live Tab](go-live).
2. Select the YouTube endpoint.
3. Finish configuring the broadcast.
4. Tap **Go Live** to open the Camera View.
5. Tap Play/Pause on the control bar to broadcast in Standby mode. Standby sends the intermission screen with muted audio.
6. Tap Play to unmute and broadcast the live camera feed.

## End the Broadcast
Press **Stop** to end the live video stream; then press **Close** to close the Camera View.

## FAQ
- If you suspect that there might be network issues, schedule a second broadcast ahead of time. This broadcast will be used if the first broadcast is interrupted and you cannot reconnect in time to continue the first broadcast.
- Auto-start must be on if you want YouTube to go live without manual action.
- Streams typically run about ten or twenty seconds behind actual time.

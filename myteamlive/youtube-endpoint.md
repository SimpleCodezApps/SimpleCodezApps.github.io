# YouTube Endpoint Guide

Schedule a YouTube broadcast and then go live on your device.

## Schedule a Broadcast on the Web
1. Visit YouTube.com and tap **Create > Go live**.
2. Choose **Manage** then **Schedule Stream**.
3. Enter title, description, category, audience, and other options.
4. Tap **Next** to configure chat and visibility.
5. Set the date and time, then tap **Done**.
6. Copy the stream key.
7. Toggle **Enable Auto-start**.
8. Toggle **Enable Auto-stop**.
9. Toggle **Enable DVR** to allow replays.
10. After scheduling your first broadcast you can reuse prior settings.

## Configure the Endpoint in MyTeamLive
1. In the [Live Streams Tab](live-streams), tap **Add Live Stream**.
2. Choose YouTube as the service to auto-fill the ingest URL.
3. Paste the stream key you copied.
4. Name the destination so you recognize it later.
5. Tap **Save**. The key can be reused for future broadcasts.

*Do this once, update if the stream key is changed.*

## Go Live
1. Open the [Go Live Tab](go-live).
2. Select the YouTube endpoint.
3. Finish configuring the broadcast.
4. Tap **Go Live** to open the Camera View.
5. Tap Play/Pause on the control bar to broadcast in Standby mode. Standby sends the intermission screen with muted audio.
6. Tap Play to unmute and broadcast the live camera feed.

## End the Broadcast
Stop the stream in the app to end the live video. Auto-stop ends it automatically if enabled.

## FAQ
- If you suspect that there might be network issues, schedule a second broadcast ahead of time. This broadcast will be used if the first broadcast is interrupted and you cannot reconnect in time to continue the first broadcast.
- Auto-start must be on if you want YouTube to go live without manual action.
- Streams typically run about ten or twenty seconds behind real time.
- DVR mode stores the broadcast for later viewing.
